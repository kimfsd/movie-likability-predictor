Datasets to download:
Letterbox Ratings: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/freeth/letterboxd-film-ratings?select=ratings.csv
-- you need to have the films.csv and ratings.csv!!!
Full TMDB Movies: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies
-- more specifically, you need to have "TMDB_movie_dataset_v11.csv"

Once all datasets are downloaded, put all the csv files into a folder called "data" that you create. Paste all the csv files into the "data" folder and run:
python3 (or python) data_clean.py to get the "final_movie_reviews.csv"

Don't worry too much about the unmatched_titles.csv... it was an intermediate step to remove some unwanted movies
